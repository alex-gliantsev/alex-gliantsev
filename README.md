  <p>

Well, the world of IT has captured me :sweat_smile:

I like everything here: learning new things, growing, communicating, and interacting. And also the endless possibilities. I have a great desire to participate in the creation or development of awesome projects.

So. I started learning the skills needed for the software testing profession independently from open sources. Then I completed a training course with a lot of practice.
Now I have experience working on a project where I met great people and learned what it means to work in a team.
